You're making a project where you want to use at least six different colours, but only one colour at a time.

Why would you choose to use an RGB LED in this project instead of multiple single-colour LEDs?

--- choices ---

- ( ) It uses less ground pins, which are limited on the Pico.

  --- feedback ---

  This is an advantage of using an RGB LED when you are working with jumper wires and only have a limited number of GND pins, but it's not the only reason.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) You only need to show one colour at a time.

  --- feedback ---

  RGB LEDs are definitely useful in situations where you only need to show one colour at a time and only need that colour in one place (single-colour LEDs are better for showing multiple colours at the same time or having lights in multiple positions). This isn't the only reason.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) It allows you to display many different colours.

  --- feedback ---

  RGB LEDs can display a huge number of different colours by adjusting the amount of red, blue, and green so they are really useful when you need to be able to show lots of different colours, or colours that aren't easily available in single-colour LEDs. This isn't the only reason.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) All of the above.

  --- feedback --- Yes! All of these are good reasons to use an RGB LED instead of multiple single-colour LEDs. Because you are working with limited ground pins and only need to show one colour at a time, using a single RGB LED allows you to display many different colours on a single ground pin. --- /feedback ---
