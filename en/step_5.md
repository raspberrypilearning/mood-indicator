**Think:** Some questions to consider in the design of the casing and interface for your mood check-in: 

+ What materials will you use? What do you have available?
+ What kind of switches will you make? How will they operate? (If you used them)
+ How will you mount your potentiometer so it is sturdy and easy to reach? (If you used one)
+ Where will you mount your LEDs for the best effect? Do you need to add any diffusers?

In <span style="color: #0faeb0">optics</span> (the study of light and seeing), a <b>diffuser</b> is any material that scatters light in some way. Some LED bulbs are quite directed in their light and so can't be seen very well from a distance, or can be painfully bright to look at from the wrong angle. Using a diffuser can help stop these things from happening and make your light shine in a much more pleasing way. You can make a very simple diffuser just by covering your LED with a thin piece of paper.

This mood check-in uses a balloon as a diffuser, and different sized conductive tokens to close separate switches and set the mood:

title: Use tape to hold jumper wires in place

Use sticky tape or electrical tape to hold jumper wires in place so that your device stays together. 

You can remove the tape later if you want to reuse the components.
