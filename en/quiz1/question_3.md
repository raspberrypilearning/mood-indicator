How many GND (ground) pins would you need on the Pico to connect the following components using jumper wires: 
1 x RGBLED
1 x Potentiometer
2 x LEDs
1 x Switch

--- choices ---

- ( ) 3 


  --- feedback ---
Try again - have a look at how many compnents there are, and consider how many GND pins each requires to operate.

- (x) 5


  --- feedback ---
Yes! Each component requires a single GND pin to operate, and there are 5 components.

This is important when you are using the Pico with jumper wires. In future you will learn how to connect multiple components to the same GND pin.
