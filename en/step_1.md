## Introduction

Create a mood check-in device with coloured lights to emote your current mood. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Paying attention to your present mood is one way to support your wellbeing. Its okay to feel angry or sad, just as it is okay to feel happy or excited. A <span style="color: #0faeb0">mood check-in</span> is a time for you to notice how you are feeling and record it or let others know about it. 
</p>

You will:
+ Represent moods or emotions using colour and light patterns
+ Develop input controls for your device to allow the user to change their mood
+ Code LED(s) to create light patterns based on different moods

To complete this project you will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico with pin headers soldered on
+ A data USB A to micro USB cable
+ RGB LED(s) or single colour LED(s)
+ A potentiometer or buttons (bought or crafted)
+ Jumper wires
+ Resistors
+ Craft materials including card, sticky tape and kitchen foil
