The Raspberry Pi Pico has eight **GND** pins so when you are using jumper wires, you can only have eight components. There is only one **3V** pin so you can only use one potentiometer. There is also a limit to how much current the Raspberry Pi Pico can supply, we recommend a maximum of 2 RGB LEDs or 6 single-colour LEDs. 

Suggested combinations of input and outputs are:
+ 3 buttons and 3 single-colour LEDs
+ 1 potentiometer and 1 RGB LED
+ 1 button and 1 RGB LED
+ 4 buttons and 1 RGB LED

You could:

**Tip:** You don't need to decide everything now. It's fine to iterate on your design as you start making.
